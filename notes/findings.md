# Findings log

Running log of results for the manuscript. All simulations use SEIR parameters ($e\_dur = 2$, $i\_dur = 3$, $R_0 = 2$, $N = 1000$) unless otherwise noted. The three individual infectiousness profiles — smooth (all-equal), stepwise, and spike (delta function) — all share the same population-level infectiousness kernel $A(\tau)$ and the same $R_0$.

## 1. Offspring distribution differs across profiles despite identical $R_0$

The smooth and spike cases both produce Poisson($R_0$) secondary infections per individual. The stepwise case produces a compound Poisson — Poisson($\beta \cdot D$) where $D \sim \text{Exp}(1/i\_dur)$ — which is overdispersed relative to Poisson($R_0$). Concretely, $\text{Var}[\text{offspring}] = R_0 + R_0^2$ for the stepwise case (a negative binomial with $k = 1$), versus $\text{Var}[\text{offspring}] = R_0$ for the smooth and spike cases.

This means the stepwise case — which is the implicit individual-level interpretation of the standard SEIR model — carries superspreading-like overdispersion even without any explicit heterogeneity in contact rates or susceptibility.

## 2. Extinction probability: identical for smooth vs. spike, elevated for stepwise

Because the smooth and spike cases share the same offspring distribution (Poisson($R_0$)), they have *exactly* the same probability of stochastic extinction in the branching process approximation. This is not merely an empirical observation — it follows from the fact that the extinction probability depends on the offspring distribution, not on the timing of transmission events.

Confirmed empirically (5,000 simulations each, $N = 1000$):
- Smooth: ~19.5% extinction (final size $< 10$)
- Spike: ~20.1% extinction

The stepwise case should have a higher extinction probability due to its overdispersed offspring distribution (a well-known result: for a fixed mean, higher variance in the offspring distribution increases extinction probability).

## 3. Establishment timing: identical mean, higher variance for spike

Conditional on the epidemic establishing, the spike case takes significantly longer *and* is more variable in reaching early case-count thresholds compared to the smooth case. This reflects the "burstiness" of the delta-function profile: quiet periods during which no transmission occurs, followed by bursts of $\sim R_0$ simultaneous infections.

Results (5,000 simulations, mean $\pm$ SD in days):

| Threshold | Smooth | Spike | Variance ratio |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| $N = 5$   | $8.5 \pm 4.7$ | $9.3 \pm 5.7$ | **1.48** ($p < 10^{-15}$) |
| $N = 10$  | $12.7 \pm 5.9$ | $13.6 \pm 6.9$ | **1.41** ($p < 10^{-15}$) |
| $N = 20$  | $17.1 \pm 6.8$ | $18.0 \pm 7.7$ | **1.27** ($p < 10^{-14}$) |
| $N = 50$  | $22.9 \pm 7.6$ | $23.7 \pm 8.4$ | **1.22** ($p < 10^{-9}$) |

The effect is strongest at the smallest thresholds and diminishes as the law of large numbers smooths out individual-level variation, consistent with the theoretical expectation.

## 4. Large epidemics converge to the same deterministic trajectory

By construction, all three profiles share the same population-level $A(\tau)$ and therefore the same mean-field ODE dynamics. Empirically, the mean cumulative infection curves for established epidemics converge to the SEIR ODE solution for all three profiles. Differences between profiles are purely stochastic and vanish in the large-population limit.

## 5. Within-individual correlation structure differs between smooth and spike

In the smooth case, a single infector generates contacts at multiple different generation intervals (spanning the full generation interval distribution). An individual who transmits early also transmits late. In the spike case, all of a person's transmissions occur at the same generation interval $\tau_i^*$. This means:

- In the smooth case, generation intervals from a common infector are positively correlated (they are draws from the same profile, conditional on the infector existing).
- In the spike case, generation intervals from a common infector are identical (all equal $\tau_i^*$), but generation intervals from *different* infectors are independent.

This distinction should produce different phylogenetic tree structures (more synchronized branching in the spike case) and different temporal autocorrelation patterns in incidence data, even when aggregate case counts are similar.

## 6. Intervention impact variance differs across profiles

Consider a one-time intervention that removes a fraction of infectious individuals at time $t$ (e.g., a quarantine sweep). In the smooth case, each removed individual has a predictable amount of remaining infectiousness. In the spike case, a removed individual has either already transmitted all $R_0$ of their infections (if $t > t_i + \tau_i^*$) or has transmitted none of them (if $t < t_i + \tau_i^*$). The expected impact of removal is similar across profiles, but the *variance* in impact is higher for the spike case — interventions are a higher-variance gamble when infectiousness is punctuated.
